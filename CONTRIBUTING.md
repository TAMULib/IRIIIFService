# Contributing to Institutional Repository International Image Interoperability Framework Service

Though *Institutional Repository International Image Interoperability Framework (IRIIIF) Service* is developed and maintained by Texas A&M University Libraries, we welcome community contributions.
Involvement in *IRIIIF Service* can take many forms.

## Using

Deploying *IRIIIF Service* and trying it out at your own institution is itself a way of contributing to the development process.
For more information on deployment strategies please see the [Deployment Guide][deployment-guide].

## Filing Issues

Once you are using *IRIIIF Service* the creation of new issues through GitHub is a major method of contribution towards *IRIIIF Service* development.
Issues can be motivated by the discovery of a bug in the software, or by the desire to see either new features added or see changes to existing features.

There are two primary types of issues:
1. Bug Report
2. Feature Request

A **Bug Report** involves a problem with the existing software or a **Feature** is not working as designed or expected.

A **Feature** involves new functionality or behavior.

## Creating a Pull Request

Community code and documentation contributions are welcome and should take the form of a **GitHub Pull Request** (*PR*).
Each *PR* will need to be reviewed by a *IRIIIF Service* developer.
A review will result in the *PR* being accepted and merged, a descriptive request for changes, or the *PR* being closed along with a detailed explanation.

It is our intention to maintain labeling on issues that are deemed to be low difficulty in order to provide a good point of entry for those looking to begin contributing code or documentation.

A *PR* description should include a list of the specific issues resolved, the predicted *semantic versioning* impact of the changes, and a description which characterizes the nature of the changes made.
When creating a *PR*, an issue template is automatically provided to simplify this process.

For more information about *semantic versioning* please see [Semantic Versioning Website][semantic-versioning].
In general keep in mind:

- A **Major Change** is a breaking change that is not backwards compatible.
- A **Minor Change** is a non-breaking change that is backwards compatible to the last **Major Change**.
- A **Patch** is a trivial change or bug fix that should not impact compatibility.
